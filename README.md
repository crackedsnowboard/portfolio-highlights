# Portfolio Hightlights
I design a porfolio to highlight key projects that I have completed to showcase growing software developer skills

## Technologies Used
I used Bootstrap for the front-end design and linked contact information to my GitHub repos and deployed links. I also have deployed a resume as a PDF.
